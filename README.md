# Skyshop

_This application was the final project of the Certified Tech Developer certification by Digital House.
The proposal was a reservation manager and the choice of theme was free. With the team we decided to work on an e-commerce of reservations and shipments of product combos through drones. Great, isn't it?_

## Deployment in Vercel (React, Vite) + Railway (Java, Spring) üì¶

_If you need a simpler process, here is the fork of the project: [Skyshop_CTD](https://github.com/juancruzmarzetti/CTD_Integrador_Equipo1)_

_And here you will find the app completely deployed: **[Skyshop](https://ctd-integrador-equipo1.vercel.app/)**_

### Pre-requirements üìã

_We should have installed MySQL and MySQL Workbench:_
**[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)**
**[MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)**

### Installation üîß and Deploy in local üì¶

_Once the repository is cloned, we must open the front end in Visual Studio Code or the IDE of choice_

_Run the following script from the terminal_

```
npm install
```

_Now we should open the Back in our IDE and run the project_

_We will see a token on the terminal, copy it and go to the Front to copy it in the Context.jsx > token (const)_


_Now that we did that, we will open the terminal and run the next script to get the localhost and test Skyshop!_

```
npm run dev
```
